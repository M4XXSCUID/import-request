 .split()

 in as an argument; if an argument is not passed in, it wil separate the string each time
 it encounters whitespace characters such as a space or return
 approved_users = "elarson,bmoreno,tshah".split(",")

 ["elarson","bmoreno","tshah"]byspli ingthestring into a separate list
 element at each occurrence of the "," character
 removed_users = "wjaffrey jsoto abernard".split()
 Converts the string "wjaffrey jsoto abernard"intothelist
 ["wjaffrey","jsoto","abernard"]byspli ingthestring into a separate
 list element at each space
 .join()
 Concatenates the elements of an iterable into a string; takes the iterable to be
 concatenated as an argument; is appended to a character that wil separate each
 element once they are joined into a string
 approved_users = ",".join(["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah"])
